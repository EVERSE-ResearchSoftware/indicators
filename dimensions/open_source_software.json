    "description": "Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Research software can be published with or without open access to the source code. Open access to source code aligns better with academic research purposes than closed source software; open source software aligns with the FAIR4RS principles. It allows other researchers to directly verify the methods used to produce the results published in papers. It also makes reproducibility much easier. In addition to these research-driven reasons, publishing research software as open source software can help with long term maintenance in a cost-effective way, since interested developers can easily contribute new functionality or fix bugs. Moreover, by integrating with the greater open source ecosystem, researchers can leverage tools and support communities already available. As such, for most academic communities with limited resources, it is also a good choice from a software engineering perspective",
