    "description": "This characteristic represents the degree to which a product under defined conditions avoids a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:\n\n- **Operational constraint**\n\nDegree to which a product or system constrains its operation to within safe parameters or states when encountering operational hazard.\n\n- **Risk identification**\n\nDegree to which a product can identify a course of events or operations that can expose life, property or environment to unacceptable risk.\n\n- **Fail safe**\n\nDegree to which a product can automatically place itself in a safe operating mode, or to revert to a safe condition in the event of a failure.\n\n- **Hazard warning**\n\nDegree to which a product or system provides warnings of unacceptable risks to operations or internal controls so that they can react in sufficient time to sustain safe operations.\n\n- **Safe integration**\n\nDegree to which a product can maintain safety during and after integration with one or more components.",
